#Chapter 3 
   
Bob and younger birds came together to plan their trip out to view this shiny object. They came up with a pretty ordinary plan to fly straight at this shiny object. They all clumped together and took off simultaneously, as if a dog or something similar was running towards them. The wind is calm, and the air is warm, the sea isn’t rough and from the sky the birds can almost see through the salty water.

As they flew higher and higher to get better wind resistance, the world became smaller below them. The beach in which they resided became just a small yellow dot, local fishing boats and surfers changed from giant objects in comparison to a bird, to just a blimp of colour in a sea of water.

The shining object which Bob originally saw is now coming into view as they fly closer and closer. In the distance it appears to be a very large narrow grey object, the bird’s excitement grows as they approach this mysterious shiny object. Fuelled by curiosity, not a single complaint is heard in regards to the effort it is taking for these guys to get there.

At long last they reach this mysterious object, its hundreds of feet up and ginormous in comparison to the flock of birds which took the journey out. They fly to the top, where a big piece of metal is turning in a circular motion, realising there is no safe place to land, and knowing there is no way they could carry a wind turbine back to land, they realise their mistake. Bobby turns to Bob and says “Well, this was pointless, I could’ve used this energy looking for a few worms”.
