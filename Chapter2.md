#Chapter 2

Bobs family crowded around him as he informed them of this possible treasure just over the sea water.
Murmurs passed through the crowd “It’s just a reflection”, “It’s probably just the water” they chirped.
But as Bob went on describing just how big this object must be, explaining it must be huge due to being able
to see it from this far out, the rest of the birds slowly became more and more interested.

Bob could see the interest growing in their eyes, their anticipation being fuelled by Bobs descriptive tone.
Once Bob knew he had got his family hooked on the idea he started planning how to get to this mysterious shiny object.
Bobby points out that it may go dark before they reach whatever it is, they can see.
“Don’t worry lil Bobby, its Spring we got the sun on our side”. All the older birds, most of which unsure of what’s going on,
don’t hide their disapproval “that’s a long ass fly, can we not stay looking at this shiny stuff”.
“You old folk stay here and entertain yourselves, go and poop on some joggers” – replies Bob in a relieved tone,
most likely due to that fact that birds cant swim and these old birds don’t look like they got much mileage left in them.
