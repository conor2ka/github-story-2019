# Chapter 1

There was once a pigeon named Bob. Bob lived along the seaside with his family of fellow birds.
One day Bob looks out into sea, a glimpse of a light catches his eye out on the horizon.
He turns to his family, a wild bunch as he likes to refer to them, and shouts (or squeaks) to grab their attention.
Bobby, Bobs youngest, turns to give a nod of acknowledgement, but like the rest can’t seem to take his eyes off a shiny empty can of 7-up that a jogger had tossed into their vicinity.

Bob stands there contemplating his decisions, either to re-join the family entertainment of looking at this shiny metal object or,
to enlighten everyone of his discovery of what could possibly be a bigger shinier object, just over the water. He looks at one then to the other,
over and over until the pigeon gives himself a headache. He jumps up, flaps his wings and shouts to everyone “I found something else”.
His family, startled at the unexpected disturbance, jump up and fly to the nearest pole before realising it was one of their own and returning.
        
“What did you find that’s so important that you needed to give us a heart attack over” comes from of the older birds.
“Look” replied Bob, pointing his wing at the glistening light just over the horizon.
